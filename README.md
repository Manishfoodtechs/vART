### 3D Gallery Project for Swinburne University

Project was created in Unity. Users would be able to visit the vArt site, and walk around a 3D respresentation of the guggenheim museum.

Through a web based admin page, images could be uploaded to the gallery, where they would be displayed in automatically generated rooms through the museum.
